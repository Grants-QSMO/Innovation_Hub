# Innovation Hub
Welcome to the Grants Quality Service Management Office (QSMO) Innovation Hub!

The Grants QSMO Innovation Hub connects the Grants Community with relevant current initiatives and innovations. By sharing innovations across the Grants ecosystem, including Federal awarding agencies, applicants/recipients and the vendor community, the Hub promotes cross-collaboration, learning, and best practice sharing among the grants community and stakeholders.

Below is a compiled list of publicly available innovations and open source codes that could be helpful for your organization’s grants work.

If you have an innovation you’d like to share, please contact GrantsQSMO@hhs.gov.

## Grant Payments <a id='grantPayments'></a>
#### FIT/NSF Blockchain for Grants Payments <a id='fitnsfBlockchain'></a>
Organizational Owner: U.S Department of Treasury's Office of Financial Innovation & Transformation (FIT/NSF)<br>
Points of Contact: Tammie Johnson - tammie.johnson@fiscal.treasury.gov; Craig Fischer (NONFED) - cfischer@think-dragon.com
- FIT/NSF’s “Blockchain for Grant Payments” initiative strives to improve grant payment processes and increase transparency for multi-tiered grant payments. Since 2017, “Blockchain for Grant Payments” has been focused on how grant recipients could use blockchain technology to tokenize (i.e. digitally represent), transfer, and redeem grant payments. 
- The initiative has led to the creation of a small blockchain proof of concept, the development and testing of a blockchain solution to manage FIT/NSF’s cell phone inventory, and provided hands-on experience with the technology. These activities made it clear that blockchain provides many benefits, including increased transparency, reduced financial and labor burden, and enhanced internal controls. It also demonstrated that using blockchain leads to process efficiencies and increased accuracy. It also provides transparency and peer-to-peer transfers of assets without a third party.

#### MITRE Blockchain for Grants Payments <a id='mitreBlockchain'></a>
Organizational Owner: The MITRE Corporation<br>
Point of Contact: Jasmine Fauber (NONFED) - jfaubert@mitre.org
- MITRE is launching a demonstration (proof-of-concept) project to explore whether and to what extent changes in business processes, coupled with use of blockchain (distributed ledger) technology, can streamline administrative burden, improve reporting, and increase transparency in the Grants Management process. The project will develop a working proof-of-concept solution and associated recommendations for solution adoption that address the challenges identified in the [previous study](https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/assessing-the-potential-to-improve-grants-management-using-blockchain). 

## Github Open Source Code <a id='githubCode'></a>
#### Single Audit Distiller <a id='singleAuditDis'></a>
Organizational Owner: General Service Administrations's (GSA) 10x Program<br>
Point of Contact: Ben Peterson - benjamin.peterson@gsa.gov
- Distiller combines data from beta.sam.gov and the Federal Audit Clearinghouse to give you quick access to single audit information.
   - [Distiller Single Audit Search Demo](https://demo-fac-distiller.app.cloud.gov/)
   - [Distiller GitHub Page](https://github.com/18F/federal-grant-reporting/wiki/Distiller)
#### Audit PDF Extraction <a id='auditPDFExtract'></a>
Organizational Owner: GSA 10x<br>
Point of Contact: Ben Peterson - benjamin.peterson@gsa.gov
- This is a proof-of-concept module that is a companion to the Distiller. Download any audit pdf from the distiller and run it though this module that reads Single Audit PDFs page by page and extracts findings text and corrective action plans which can be viewed as a csv.
   - [Audit PDF Extraction GitHub Page](https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=ef2f2bc4-b37a2214-ef2f1afb-0cc47a6a52de-2c5700c858984ca5&u=https://github.com/18F/federal-grant-reporting/wiki/Audit-PDF-Extraction)
#### Single Audit Finding Resolution <a id='singleAuditFindingResolution'></a>
Organizational Owner: GSA 10x<br>
Point of Contact: Rhys Furreigh
- SAFR or Single Audit Finding Resolution tool focuses on the high-priority post-award financial grant reporting. By facilitating direct communication and increasing visibility into the state of work, the prototype dramatically 1) streamlines the finding resolution process and 2) gives agencies unprecedented visibility into single audit findings relevant to their shared grantees, thereby reducing costly duplication of effort for agencies and grantees alike.
   - [SAFR GitHub Page](https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=f4188cca-a84d851a-f418bdf5-0cc47a6a52de-53769031945f14d2&u=https://github.com/18F/federal-grant-reporting/wiki/Single-Audit-Finding-Resolution-(SAFR))
#### SF 425 Auto Populator <a id='sf425AutoPop'></a>
Organizational Owner: GSA 10x<br>
Point of Contact: Ben Peterson - benjamin.peterson@gsa.gov
- The FFR, or SF-425, is a form grantees have to fill out and submit at least four times per year.
- To reduce duplicative, error prone data entry this tool fills out more than a quarter of the FFR's fields using data from SAM.gov, where all grant applicants must register before applying for grants.
